# 👋 Hi, I'm Jan

I'm a passionate developer focused on building fast, efficient, and creative solutions — especially in **real-time systems**, **3D graphics**, and **simulations**. I also enjoy experimenting with **artificial intelligence**, and I've done some work using **PyTorch** for neural network prototyping.

## 🧠 What I enjoy working with

- 🧊 3D graphics & physics-based simulations
- 🤖 AI & neural networks with PyTorch 
- ⚙️ C++, Python, and occasionally Java  
- 🧪 Algorithms, data structures, spatial partitioning  
- 🎮 Game engines, terminal graphics, visual tools for developers  

## 🚧 Projects worth checking out

- [Boid Simulation in C++](https://github.com/Rejman333/FlockingAlgorithm)
  A high-performance flocking simulation using QuadTree and Raylib

- [Image Viewer in Python](https://github.com/Rejman333/Py_g_debug-UniversityTask)  
  A simple, IrfanView-inspired image viewer made with Tkinter

- [Ant Colony Algorithm Visualizer](https://github.com/Rejman333/ant_colony_algorithm_visualizer_python)
  A Python-based visual demonstration of ant colony optimization solving pathfinding problems
